	<b>Introduction : </b>
</h1>

---

The objective of this project is to create a simple shell and learn a lot about
processes and file descriptors.

The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT.
With Minishell project, we’ll be able to travel through time and come back to
problems people faced when Windows didn’t exist.
